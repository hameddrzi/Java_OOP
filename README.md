# 📌 OOP JAVA - Object-Oriented Programming in Java  

Welcome to the **OOP JAVA** repository! 🚀  
This project is designed for those who want to deepen their knowledge of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java** with practical examples, detailed explanations, and well-structured code.  

## 📖 Introduction  
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on **classes** and **objects**, promoting code reuse, modularity, and maintainability.  

### 🔍 In this repository, you will find:  
- ✅ **Basic and advanced OOP concepts** (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction)  
- ✅ **Practical examples and well-documented code**  
- ✅ **Best practices for writing clean and scalable code**  
- ✅ **Projects and exercises to apply your knowledge**  

## 📌 Key OOP Concepts  
- 🔹 **Classes and Objects** – Creating and using objects in Java  
- 🔹 **Encapsulation** – Protecting data through access modifiers  
- 🔹 **Inheritance** – Reusing code among related classes  
- 🔹 **Polymorphism** – Using methods with the same name but different behaviors  
- 🔹 **Abstraction** – Creating abstract classes and interfaces
